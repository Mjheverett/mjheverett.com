## Hi I'm Matthew!

I'm a software developer, freelancer, coffee enthusiast, homelabber, & DIY-er working in Atlanta, GA. 

I work with a Laravel, PHP, Vue, PostgreSQL stack and am always dabbling in learning new languages and skills. I transitioned to development after graduating as a chemical engineer and working for a number of years in environmental testing.

All freelance work is done through my company [Theorem Technologies, LLC](https://theoremtechnologies.co). I primarily create websites and web applications with custom features that can't be found in existing solutions.

This site serves as a hub for portfolio projects and a blog, as I hope to write some about specific interests and solutions.
